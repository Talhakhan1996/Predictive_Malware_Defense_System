# Predictive_Malware_Defense_System
# Overview & Summary
This project is based on automated malware prediction. The main aim of this project is to keep defenders a step ahead of attackers, an evolution algorithm has been implemented that predicts pattern of future malware behavior. Weâ€™ll focus on multiple aspects of the automated malware prediction by machine learning techniques in order to achieve maximum accuracy.
# Objectives
- Traditional AV or anti malware solution works on signatures.
