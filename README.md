# Overview & Summary
This project is based on automated malware prediction. The main aim of this project is to keep defenders a step ahead of attackers, an evolution algorithm has been implemented that predicts pattern of future malware behavior. Weâ€™ll focus on multiple aspects of the automated malware prediction by machine learning techniques in order to achieve maximum accuracy.
# Objectives
- Traditional AV or anti malware solution works on signatures.
- Polymorphic malware bypass these traditional detection solutions.
- Malware detection is a classification problem.
- Machine learning learns the dataset and then based on its learning, it predicts: malware/not malware.
- Supply more and more latest dataset to improve machine learning model performance.
